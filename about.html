    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <div id="about-us">

    <p>The history of rail transport in Kenya dates back to the period between 1891 and 1895 when raging debates ensued in the British parliament over the necessity of constructing a railway line through a country owned by the Maasai and unlettered African tribesmen.
        It was laughed off as extremely ridiculous. The cost which was pegged at 5 million pounds was considered exorbitant and earned the line so much resentment in the British parliament and media. 
        Henry Labouchere, the British politician and perhaps the lineâ€™s harshest critic in what is now a famous poem christened the whole venture an act of lunacy.
